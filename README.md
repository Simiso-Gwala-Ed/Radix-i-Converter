# Decimal to any Radix-i (Base 2 to 16) Converter  

This main file is a program written in C, that will convert from a positive decimal to any radix-i (bases being from 2 to 16) number.

The main file consists of 2 custom functions:

- The "log_a_to_base_b," which uses the built-in log2 function to convert any 2 input (a, b) to return a value a from logb.

- The "Dec2RadixI" is the function that converts from base 10 to any base from 2 to 16.

The main file greets the user upon execution.
